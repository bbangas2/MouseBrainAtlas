#### Where can I download the files that describe the atlas?

  To download the volumes of each structure, along with their coordinates in the atlas space, locate the file paths according to [the "Atlas structures" section in the "BuildAtlas" page](BuildAtlas.md#put-average-shape-at-average-position). Refer to ["Volume" section in "DataDescription" page](DataDescription.md#volumes) for details.
